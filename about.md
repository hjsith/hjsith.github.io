    title: "Where did I study?"
    excerpt: "I completed the Bachelor of Information Technology (Co-op) at the University of Technology Sydney under the prestigious Co-op scholarship in which only 30-40 students get accepted each year. During this fast-tracked 3 year degree, I completed two 6-month full-time internships: as an Associate Software Engineer at WiseTech Global, and a Hybrid Cloud Services Intern at Westpac. Whilst I gained a lot of experience with both the business and technical sides of IT, I primarily focused on software engineering."
